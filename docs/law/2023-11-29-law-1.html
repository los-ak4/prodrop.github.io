        <p>Good been the break everyone,</p>
<p>Thank you for attending the last Pro-Drop English conference. Am sending this email to remind you of the new changes have made to our beautiful language &lt;3.</p>
<p>This week have added:</p>
<p>Op is op in op-cop-drop.</p>
<p>Past tense optative, as seen in good been the break or gorpeld you.</p>
<p>New question particle by Aidan: ESKA! Eska good? Is a loan word from French.</p>
<p>Alternatively, Hussein suggests reduplication of the verb at the end of the sentence: Is a good idea is? The two options will battle it out over the next week!</p>
<p>Have also decided that will accept emphatic uptalk. All will know it when see it.</p>
<p>Die be the you, although seemingly ungrammatical, has been accepted as a licit sentence. Is very emphatic. Reserve reserve for your meanest moments!</p>
<p>New set of words: mey, meyor, meyest, meyeny, pamey. Mey means old and good. Pamey means young and bad. Will stabilize with more use.</p>
<p>You are born pamey and will later become mey through the first gorping ritual. WIll figure that out next week.</p>
<p>Gorping is now optionally ditransitive: the meyest gorps meyor mey. Is an important part of our culture.</p>
<p>Meyest gorps meyor mey also has the idiomatic meaning of letting things run their natural course.</p>
<p>The second meyest is the double gorper means when one door closes another door opens.</p>
<p>Gorping is also proselytizing the Pro-Drop English language.</p>
<p>So many elves means an opinion came from the unpopular grapevine, so few elves means it's a good take. For example, so many elves came up with Government and Binding Theory.</p>
<p>Opportunities for further research:</p>
<p>-our rituals and culture</p>
<p>-establishing our question system better</p>
<p>-understanding meyeny</p>
<p>-Audrey's dialect vs Hussein and Aidan's dialects fight to the death</p>
<p>Eska God meyest?</p>
<p>Happy wedding!</p>
